# Elasticsearch-and-python
We often face service breakdowns and we can just see the overview of it in Grafana or Kibana in the form of time series but what if we want to dig deep and there is a need of root cause analysis. As our elastic cluster hold data for just the past two weeks so its very important that we should get the data of the breakdowns to analyze it and store it for future prospects. In this process I am going to describe certain ways to dump elastic cluster data into python in the form of data frame. Once we will get the raw data we can do any kind of analysis with it and can avoid same kind of interruption in future.
